<p>Hello there! My name is Luuk Tol, and I'm a Front-End Development student at the HVA (University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam). 
This site is my Digital Gardenâ€”a personal space on the web where I plant the seeds of new ideas and watch them grow. 
It's a living collection of experiments, a playground where I tinker with code, explore new technologies, and push my creative boundaries. 
Each project you'll find here is a step in my journey to hone my skills and become a better front-end developer.</p>
